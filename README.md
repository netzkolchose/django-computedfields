### django-computedfields

django-computedfields provides autoupdated database fields
for model methods.

Tested with Django 4.2 and 5.2 (Python 3.8 to 3.13).


#### Example

Just derive your model from `ComputedFieldsModel` and place
the `@computed` decorator at a method:

```python
from django.db import models
from computedfields.models import ComputedFieldsModel, computed

class MyModel(ComputedFieldsModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)

    @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[('self', ['name'])])
    def computed_field(self):
        return self.name.upper()
```

`computed_field` will be turned into a real database field
and can be accessed and searched like any other database field.
During saving the associated method gets called and itâ€™s result
written to the database.


#### How to recalculate without saving the model record

If you need to recalculate the computed field but without saving it, use
`from computedfields.models import compute`

```python
>>> from computedfields.models import compute
>>> person = MyModel.objects.get(id=1)  # this is to retrieve existing record
>>> person.computed_field               # outputs 'BERTY'
>>> person.name = 'nina'                # changing the dependent field `name` to nina
>>> compute(person, 'computed_field')   # outputs 'NINA'
>>> person.computed_field               # outputs 'BERTY' because the `person` is not yet saved
>>> person.save()                       # alters the database record for `name` and `computed_field`
>>> person.computed_field               # outputs 'NINA'
```

#### `depends` keyword

The  `depends` keyword argument can be used with any relation to indicate dependencies to fields on other models as well:

```python
from django.db import models
from computedfields.models import ComputedFieldsModel, computed

class MyModel(ComputedFieldsModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    fk = models.ForeignKey(SomeModel)

    @computed(
        models.CharField(max_length=32),
        depends=[
            ('self', ['name']),
            ('fk', ['fieldname'])
        ]
    )
    def computed_field(self):
        return self.name.upper() + self.fk.fieldname
```

Now changes to `self.name`, `fk` or `fk.fieldname` will update `computed_field`.


#### Alternative Syntax

Instead of using the `@computed` decorator with inline field definitions,
you can also use a more declarative syntax with `ComputedField`, example from above rewritten:

```python
from django.db import models
from computedfields.models import ComputedFieldsModel, ComputedField

def get_upper_string(inst):
    return inst.name.upper()

class MyModel(ComputedFieldsModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    computed_field = ComputedField(
        models.CharField(max_length=32),
        depends=[('self', ['name'])],
        compute=get_upper_string
    )
```

      Note that Django 2.2 will keep working until real incompatible code changes occur.
      This may happen by any later release, thus treat 0.1.6 as last compatible version.
