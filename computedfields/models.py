        This method triggers all the ugly stuff.
        Without providing a map file the calculations are done
        once per process by ``app.ready``. The steps are:
            - create a graph of the dependencies
            - cycling check
            - remove redundant paths
            - create final resolver lookup map

        transparently load the map file omitting the graph and map

        computed model fields dependencies and therefore override the
        "once per process" rule with ``_force``. Dont use this

        force the recreation of the graph and map, use ``force`` instead.

        This is needed if you have computed fields that depend on a model
        changed by bulk actions. Simply call this function after the update
        with the queryset containing the changed objects.
        The queryset may not be finalized by ``distinct`` or any other means.

        This can also be used with ``bulk_create``. Since ``bulk_create``
        returns the objects in a python container, you have to create the queryset
        yourself, e.g. with pks:

        .. NOTE::

            This function cannot be used to update computed fields on a
            computed fields model itself. For computed fields models always
            use ``save`` on the model objects. You still can use

                ...     obj.save()

            (This behavior might change with future versions.)

        For completeness - ``instance`` can also be a single model instance.
        Since calling ``save`` on a model instance will trigger this function by
        the ``post_save`` signal it should not be invoked for single model
        instances if they get saved anyways.

        intersections, those items would be queried and saved several times.

def computed(field, **kwargs):
    """
    Decorator to create computed fields.

    ``field`` should be a model field suitable to hold the result
    of the decorated method. The decorator understands an optional
    keyword argument ``depends`` to indicate dependencies to
    related model fields. Listed dependencies will automatically
    update the computed field.

    Examples:

        - create a char field with no outer dependencies

          .. code-block:: python

            @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32))
            def ...

        - create a char field with one dependency to the field
          ``name`` of a foreign key relation ``fk``

          .. code-block:: python

            @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=['fk#name'])
            def ...

    The dependency string is in the form ``'rel_a.rel_b#fieldname'``,
    where the computed field gets a value from a field ``fieldname``,
    which is accessible through the relations ``rel_a`` --> ``rel_b``.
    A relation can be any of foreign key, m2m, o2o and their
    corresponding back relations.

    The fieldname at the end separated by '#' is mandatory for other
    computed fields and can be omitted for ordinary fields:

    .. code-block:: python

        @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=['fk'])
        def some_field(self):
            return self.fk.name + self.fk.field_xy

    Here ``name`` and ``field_xy`` are ordinary fields. Pointing to ``fk``
    in the depends string is sufficient for a proper update handling.

    On the contrary dependencies to other computed fields should be listed
    separately to get updated after changes:

    .. code-block:: python

        @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=['fk#computed1', 'fk#computed2'])
        def some_field(self):
            return self.fk.computed1 + self.fk.computed2

    .. CAUTION::

        With the dependency auto resolver you can easily create
        recursive dependencies by accident. Imagine the following:

        .. code-block:: python

            class A(ComputedFieldsModel):
                @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=['b_set#comp'])
                def comp(self):
                    return ''.join(b.comp for b in self.b_set.all())

            class B(ComputedFieldsModel):
                a = models.ForeignKey(A)

                @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=['a#comp'])
                def comp(self):
                    return a.comp

        Neither an object of ``A`` or ``B`` can be saved, since the
        ``comp`` fields depend on each other. While it is quite easy
        to spot for this simple case it might get tricky for more
        complicated dependencies. Therefore the dependency resolver tries
        to detect cyclic dependencies and raises a ``CycleNodeException``
        if a cycle was found.

        If you experience this in your project try to get in-depth cycle
        information, either by using the ``rendergraph`` management command or
        by accessing the graph object directly under ``your_model._graph``.
        Also see the graph documentation :ref:`here<graph>`.
