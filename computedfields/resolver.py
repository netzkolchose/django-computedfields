Your depends keyword argument is malformed.

The depends keyword should either be None, an empty listing or
a listing of rules as depends=[rule1, rule2, .. ruleN].

A rule is formed as ('relation.path', ['list', 'of', 'fieldnames']) tuple.
The relation path either contains 'self' for fieldnames on the same model,
or a string as 'a.b.c', where 'a' is a relation on the current model
descending over 'b' to 'c' to pull fieldnames from 'c'. The denoted fieldnames
must be concrete fields on the rightmost model of the relation path.

Example:
depends=[
    ('self', ['name', 'status']),
    ('parent.color', ['value'])
]
This has 2 path rules - one for fields 'name' and 'status' on the same model,
and one to a field 'value' on a foreign model, which is accessible from
the current model through self -> parent -> color relation.

            >>> Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010).update(comments_on=False)
            >>> update_dependent(Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010))

        This can also be used with ``bulk_create``. Since ``bulk_create``
        returns the objects in a python container, you have to create the queryset
        yourself, e.g. with pks:

            >>> objs = Entry.objects.bulk_create([
            ...     Entry(headline='This is a test'),
            ...     Entry(headline='This is only a test'),
            ... ])
            >>> pks = set(obj.pk for obj in objs)
            >>> update_dependent(Entry.objects.filter(pk__in=pks))

        .. NOTE::

            Getting pks from ``bulk_create`` is not supported by all database adapters.
            With a local computed field you can "cheat" here by providing a sentinel:

                >>> MyComputedModel.objects.bulk_create([
                ...     MyComputedModel(comp='SENTINEL'), # here or as default field value
                ...     MyComputedModel(comp='SENTINEL'),
                ... ])
                >>> update_dependent(MyComputedModel.objects.filter(comp='SENTINEL'))

            If the sentinel is beyond reach of the method result, this even ensures to update
            only the newly added records.

        `instance` can also be a single model instance. Since calling ``save`` on a model instance
        will trigger this function by the `post_save` signal already it should not be called
        for single instances, if they get saved anyway.

        `update_fields` can be used to indicate, that only certain fields on the queryset changed,
        which helps to further narrow down the records to be updated.

        Special care is needed, if a bulk action contains foreign key changes,
        that are part of a computed field dependency chain. To correctly handle that case,
        provide the result of ``preupdate_dependent`` as `old` argument like this:

                >>> # given: some computed fields model depends somehow on Entry.fk_field
                >>> old_relations = preupdate_dependent(Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010))
                >>> Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010).update(fk_field=new_related_obj)
                >>> update_dependent(Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010), old=old_relations)

        `update_local=False` disables model local computed field updates of the entry node. 
        (used as optimization during tree traversal). You should not disable it yourself.

        Decorator to create computed fields.

        `field` should be a model concrete field instance suitable to hold the result
        of the decorated method. The decorator expects a keyword argument `depends`
        to indicate dependencies to model fields (local or related).
        Listed dependencies will automatically update the computed field.

        Examples:

            - create a char field with no further dependencies (not very useful)

            .. code-block:: python

                @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32))
                def ...

            - create a char field with a dependency to the field ``name`` on a
              foreign key relation ``fk``

            .. code-block:: python

                @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[('fk', ['name'])])
                def ...

        Dependencies should be listed as ``['relation_name', concrete_fieldnames]``.
        The relation can span serveral models, simply name the relation
        in python style with a dot (e.g. ``'a.b.c'``). A relation can be any of
        foreign key, m2m, o2o and their back relations. The fieldnames must point to
        concrete fields on the foreign model.

        .. NOTE::

            Dependencies to model local fields should be list with ``'self'`` as relation name.

        With `select_related` and `prefetch_related` you can instruct the dependency resolver
        to apply certain optimizations on the update queryset.

        .. NOTE::

            `select_related` and `prefetch_related` are stacked over computed fields
            of the same model during updates, that are marked for update.
            If your optimizations contain custom attributes (as with `to_attr` of a
            `Prefetch` object), these attributes will only be available on instances
            during updates from the resolver, never on newly constructed instances or
            model instances pulled by other means, unless you applied the same lookups manually.

            To keep the computed field methods working under any circumstances,
            it is a good idea not to rely on lookups with custom attributes,
            or to test explicitly for them in the method with an appropriate plan B.

        With `default_on_create` set to ``True`` the function calculation will be skipped
        for newly created or copy-cloned instances, instead the value will be set from the
        inner field's `default` argument.

        .. CAUTION::

            With the dependency resolver you can easily create recursive dependencies
            by accident. Imagine the following:

            .. code-block:: python

                class A(ComputedFieldsModel):
                    @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[('b_set', ['comp'])])
                    def comp(self):
                        return ''.join(b.comp for b in self.b_set.all())

                class B(ComputedFieldsModel):
                    a = models.ForeignKey(A)

                    @computed(models.CharField(max_length=32), depends=[('a', ['comp'])])
                    def comp(self):
                        return a.comp

            Neither an object of `A` or `B` can be saved, since the ``comp`` fields depend on
            each other. While it is quite easy to spot for this simple case it might get tricky
            for more complicated dependencies. Therefore the dependency resolver tries
            to detect cyclic dependencies and might raise a ``CycleNodeException`` during
            startup.

            If you experience this in your project try to get in-depth cycle
            information, either by using the ``rendergraph`` management command or
            by directly accessing the graph objects:

            - intermodel dependency graph: ``active_resolver._graph``
            - mode local dependency graphs: ``active_resolver._graph.modelgraphs[your_model]``
            - union graph: ``active_resolver._graph.get_uniongraph()``

            Note that there is not graph object, when running with ``COMPUTEDFIELDS_MAP = True``.
            In that case either comment out that line `settings.py` and restart the server
            or build the graph at runtime with:

                >>> from computedfields.graph import ComputedModelsGraph
                >>> from computedfields.resolver import active_resolver
                >>> graph = ComputedModelsGraph(active_resolver.computed_models)

            Also see the graph documentation :ref:`here<graph>`.
